# Identity Module

Identity owns template-level local identity and application authorization
behavior.

Identity owns:

- Local user aggregates mapped to OIDC subjects.
- Lazy local user creation after successful authentication.
- Application-owned application access aggregates.
- Current-user context contracts.
- Initial admin access grant behavior used by setup tooling.

The Host owns OIDC challenge/callback/logout mechanics, cookie configuration,
Redis-backed session ticket storage, and API authentication behavior.

Identity-provider roles, groups, and organization membership are not
authoritative product authorization sources.

## Current Implementation Slice

Identity follows the backend module pattern described in the server
architecture docs. It defines provider-neutral current-user contracts, local
user aggregates, application access aggregates, Mediator command handlers, and
module-owned repository contracts. A valid authenticated principal with a stable
provider subject lazily creates or updates one local user by `(provider,
subject)`.

Application access is represented by active application-owned access state.
Missing or inactive access means the user is authenticated without product
access; they do not become unauthenticated. A setup command can grant one
configured provider/subject pair active initial admin/application access. It is
idempotent when access is already active and refuses to silently reactivate
revoked access unless the caller explicitly forces the operation.

The Host owns claim parsing. Identity current-user behavior consumes a
provider-neutral authenticated identity value and resolves local user plus
application access state from application-owned data.

Identity currently records these stable domain event types:

- `identity.local-user-created`
- `identity.local-user-seen`
- `identity.application-access-granted`
- `identity.application-access-revoked`
